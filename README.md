 <li> Pressing the Q key picks up an item. </li>
 <li> Pressing the E key uses said item. You can refill your watering can when it is empty by clicking E next to the well while you are holding it. You can go to sleep by pressing E next to Alice's house while you have no items in your hands. </li>
 <li> You can till soil by using the hoe on grass and plant seeds by using them on tilled dirt. </li>
 <li> Water your plants every day so that they grow big and produce lots of crops! </li>
 <li> Harvest your crops by placing them in crates to be sold! Crates fill once they have 10 vegetables in them! </li>
